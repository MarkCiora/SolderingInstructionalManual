# Pitt Fuego FAQ

**Q: How do I get started teaching students to work with code?**

A: Start with our introductory programs, Electrate Fuego or I AM; A project in becoming. 

**Q: Wait a minute! What about me? How do I get started learning to work with code?**

A: The same way silly! But **YOU** should get started working with code before you facilitate these lessons in your class. Get to know your code editor. Get to know the affinity spaces to which you will be sending your students for answers. Share your own work - even your own problems and frustrations – with your students. 

**Q: Where are the directions?**

A: They are embedded in the code. Teach students to use a code editor to open the index.html fime and style.css file to find the directions. 

**Q: Can my students really figure out how to work with code?**

A: If you and your students can’t figure out Pitt Fuego, then WE have a problem. Please let us know. 

**Q: How do I assess this?**

A: Set expectations: demand students work with code to meet specific requirements and goals for content, usability, and aesthetics, but assess actual learning, presentation, and participation rather than product. 

**Q: What if a student already knows everything there is to know about .HTML and .CSS?**

A:  No problem. Pitt Fuego is only a multimodal communication tool. While we can use the code to help us arrange, style, and circulate our content, we still need to invent content and connect with our audience. 

**Q: What is computational thinking?**

A: Computational thinking includes aspects of pattern recognition, algorithmic thinking, decomposition, and abstraction. While experts have argued that writing code is not the same thing as computational thinking, the process can be…if we encourage our students to focus on aspects of computational thinking throughout our praxis.
